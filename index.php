<h2>Dear Mom and Dad,</h2>

<p>I wanted to share these glimpses of the past, our family's past with you.  I wanted you to know that these moments mattered to me.  That they matter.  When you refresh the page, a new fragment will appear.  I hope to keep adding to this, to keep building on to what I have collected so far.  These memories, triggered by a smell or the quality of the air, linger for me.  They persevere, and I am thankful for that.  For in them, we are together.</p>
