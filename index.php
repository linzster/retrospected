      <p>We wanted to share these glimpses of the past, our family's past with you.  We wanted you to know that these 
      moments mattered.  That they matter.  When you refresh the page, a new fragment will appear.  We hope to 
      keep adding to this, to keep building on to what we have collected so far.  These memories, often triggered 
      by a smell or the quality of the air, linger for us.  They persevere, and we am thankful for that.  For in 
      them, we are together.</p>
