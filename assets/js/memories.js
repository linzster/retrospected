memories.push("Bike ride at Moraine State Park.  Lunch on a pier.  Crunching Doritos beneath a marshmallow cloud sky.");
memories.push("That sandwhich place outside Hamilton College.  Best sandwhich I have ever had.  Still.");
memories.push("Walks, walking, through cemeteries, to coffeeshops, and later pushing strollers.");
memories.push("Do you remember?  I do.  These moments I carry with me.  Is it like that for you?");
memories.push("I've thought about texting you, these shimmering glimpses of the past. But sometimes I don't have my phone, and even if I did, the medium didn't seem right.");
memories.push("Texts don't hold enough weight, and the lightness would betray something, I fear.  Something I want you to know.");
memories.push("They surface when life settles for an instant.  Then I'm back, back in time, back with you, and these memories are moments, are happening again.");  
memories.push("Mom, in your purple robe, stepping out into the Chautauqua morning.  I could feel the sun, early as it was.");
memories.push("Being rocked through ear infections.  The pain pacified by back and forth, back and forth.");
memories.push("Windows down, Bob Dylan loud.  'Everybody must get stoned.'  Driving in circles in Timberglen.  Did that song ever end?");
memories.push("Windows down, the morning dark on our way to school.  Windows up, and warmer.  At least that was the idea, right?");
memories.push("These moments aren't pinnable.  We don't blog about them.  They are traces.  They return.  They last.");
memories.push("The news had gone out of the first world war...Christmas bells, those Christmas bells...");
memories.push("Weekend mornings riding downtown to basketball at Reizenstein.  There, game after game, basketballs against floorboards, against backboards endlessly.  And you in the stands.");
memories.push("Turn-signal on, lights off, police car turning towards and I almost side-swipe a car.  You yelling: 'Stop the car.  Just stop the car!'  So I did.  In the middle of the road.  But I drove the rest of the way home, knuckles white.  Cautious.  Terrified.");
memories.push("Graduation party and a human fly wall in our driveway.  All night, we jumped against the wall, got stuck, and wrestled free.  We do that now: jump, stick, wrestle free.  Sometimes we hurdle the wall, and sometimes we need help getting down.");
memories.push("It doesn't get any better than this.");
memories.push("The score, the team, my shot: different every game.  You in the stands: always.");
memories.push("We pile onto the stairs in our santa hats and pajamas.  We smile for pictures though we want to move on to our stockings, the brightly wrapped presents.  But we stay on the stairs together, the magic of Christmas full and sweet.");
memories.push("Uno!");
memories.push("Bread!");
memories.push("Walking down to the neighbor's garage to give Dad his new Mustang. Then convincing him it wasn't a rental.");
memories.push("Walks around the neighborhood with Chestnut, Aubrey, and Milo.");
memories.push("The best surprise 18th birthday party at Spotswood Pool.");
memories.push("Playing Uno on New Year's Eve, and trying to keep Mom awake :)");
memories.push("Hilton Head vacations! The bike rides, the beach walks, the mini golf, Greg Russell.");
memories.push("Getting the best block letter birthday signs ever.");
memories.push("Coffee and breakfast from Panera on weekends.");
memories.push("Loading up on bulk candy before Camp Kon-O-Kwee weeks.");
memories.push("Shooting hoops and epic games of 1-on-1 in the driveway.");
memories.push("Watching Dad turn a rough slab of writing stone into a beautiful, polished gem, the night before a deadline.");
